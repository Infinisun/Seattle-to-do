    <h2>My Purpose</h2>
    <p>I'll ideally be going to school in Seattle and would really love to live there for sometime.</p>
    <p>I want to utilize as much time as I can to really live while I am there, and collecting as much informtion about the city is my best bet I believe.</p>
    <p>With this page I would like to gather this following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel Plans</li>
      <li>Resources</li>
      <li>Attractions</li>
      <li>And More!!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To help me get started, here is a link to <a href="https://www.seattle.gov">Seattle's Home Page</a>.</p>
    <p>There is an ample amount of information and resources here to help guide my path!</p>
